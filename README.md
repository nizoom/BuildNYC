# BuiltNYC

Built NYC is a data visualization tool that explores building development in New York City. 
Using a data base provided by NYC Open Data the user can filter building demolitions / constructions by year and borough on a location specific map. Each location is a clickable pin that displays the address, owner, and contracting company of the site. 
I Built an API to receive requests from the app which converts those requests into Socrata Query Language. 
This QL is used to fetch building data. Data visualizations are supplemented by charts that illustrate a breakdown of construction permits by type and construction trends for the last 30 years.
